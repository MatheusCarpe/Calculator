# Calculator

# Overview

This Python project implements a simple calculator that performs basic mathematical operations
such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator allows users to input two
numeric values and select the desired operation. The project is organized into multiple files for
modularity and readability.

# Files
# 1. calculator.py

This file serves as the main entry point for the calculator application. It provides a menu for users to select the desired mathematical operation. The available operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# 2. numbers.py
This file contains a utility function get_valid_input() that prompts the user to enter two
numeric values. It ensures that the input values are valid numeric entries.
